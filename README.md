# Helping Hand  
### Empowering children with developmental disabilities through interactive ASL learning  

---

## 🧩 Overview  

Helping Hand is an assistive education project that combines robotics and sign language learning to help children with developmental disabilities learn the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet in an engaging, hands-on way.  

At its core, Helping Hand uses a robotic hand capable of physically demonstrating ASL letter signs. The system provides a visual and tangible learning experience, bridging the gap between digital learning and physical interaction for children who benefit from real-world reinforcement.  

We are excited to work on this project!!

## 🎯 Mission  

To make ASL education accessible, interactive, and inclusive. Empower every child, regardless of ability, to communicate confidently.

## 📂 Project Structure

The goal of the the repo is to have the following structure

```  
├── arduino/        # Code for the arduino that controls the robot arm  
├── src/            # Code for the web interface  
├── data/           # Any data we collect/need (currently empty)  
└── README.md       # This file  
```

Keep in mind this can all change

## 🧠 The Idea  

Children with developmental disabilities often learn best through visual and tactile cues. Helping Hand uses:  

- 🖐️ A robotic hand prototype that performs ASL signs for each letter  
- 💻 Software integration that translates digital letters or audio cues into physical hand movements  
- 🧒 Interactive feedback loops that let kids mimic, repeat, and learn at their own pace  

This project aims to make learning ASL fun, interactive, and sensory-rich, fostering engagement and self-confidence.
